DevOps Fraud Shield – Short Project Summary

Team Introduction

We are Team ERROR-404, consisting of:

    • Abdul Sammed – Team Lead
      
    • Shaik Shafi – Developer
      
Our focus is on creating intelligent DevSecOps solutions that enhance pipeline security and provide real-time protection against evolving threats in modern software delivery.

Project Objective

DevOps Fraud Shield aims to secure CI/CD pipelines by detecting fraudulent, malicious, or unauthorized activities using a combination of AI/ML analytics and GitLab DevSecOps tools.
The objective is to:

    1) Identify suspicious commits and abnormal contributor behavior

    2) Prevent unauthorized pipeline execution
       
    3) Strengthen supply-chain and code integrity
       
    4) Provide real-time visibility into pipeline security
       
    5) This ensures safer, more compliant, and more trustworthy DevOps workflows.


 Key Features

 1. AI-Driven Fraud Detection

    • Isolation Forest–based anomaly detection

    • Real-time fraud risk scoring
      
2. Live Webhook Monitoring

    • GitLab/GitHub webhooks send pipeline and commit events instantly
      
    • Backend performs validation, signature checks, and threat analysis

3. Security Dashboard

    • Real-time pipeline metrics and risk graphs
      
    • Alerts table with severity levels
      
    • Status indicators for backend/ML engine health

4. Automated Alerts

    • Slack notifications for high-risk commits
      
    • Email alerts with event details
      
    • Helps security teams respond faster
      
      5. DevSecOps Architecture
      
    • FastAPI backend + React dashboard
      
    • Machine learning detection engine
      
    • Docker-based deployment with microservices design
      
Workflow (Step-by-Step)

	Step 1 — Git Event Trigger

    • Push/MR triggers GitLab webhook
      
    • Webhook payload sent to FastAPI endpoint
      
      Step 2 — Pre-Processing
      
    • Extract commit author, file changes, timestamps
      
    • Check for suspicious keywords or patterns
      
      Step 3 — ML-Based Analysis
      
    • Features passed into Isolation Forest model
      
    • Model detects anomalies
      
      Step 4 — Rule Engine
      
    • Additional checks:
      
    • Large file diffs
      
    • Sensitive file edits
      
    • Unexpected contributor activity
      
    • Step 5 — Risk Scoring
      
    • Combines AI output + security rules
      
    • Produces numeric fraud score
      
      Step 6 — Alerting System
      
    • High-risk events trigger Slack/email alerts
      
    • Event logged into database
      
      Step 7 — Dashboard Visualization
      
    • React dashboard fetches data
      
    • Displays risk trends, alerts, pipeline health




GitLab Tools Used

 1. GitLab Webhooks

    • Used for real-time event ingestion:
      
    • Push events
      
    • Merge requests
      
    • Pipeline triggers
      
      2. GitLab CI/CD Pipelines

    • Automates:
      
    • Testing
      
    • Linting
      
    • Deployment
      
    • Security scans
      
      3. GitLab Security Tools
      
    • SAST – Detects insecure code patterns
      
    • DAST – Dynamic scanning of running service
      
    • Dependency Scanning – Flags vulnerable libraries
      
    • These enhance security beyond the AI layer.
      
      4. GitLab Container Registry
      
    • Stores and manages Docker images used in deployment.
      
Summary

DevOps Fraud Shield integrates AI-based detection with GitLab's DevSecOps ecosystem to create a real-time fraud detection system for CI/CD pipelines.
The solution improves pipeline security, prevents malicious activity, and provides actionable insights to DevOps teams — making software delivery safer and more reliable.
