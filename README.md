# 🛡️ DevOps Fraud Shield

A comprehensive DevSecOps solution that leverages AI/ML to detect fraudulent activities in CI/CD pipelines, protecting against code injection, unauthorized access, and malicious commits.

## 📖 Overview

DevOps Fraud Shield provides real-time monitoring and analysis of DevOps workflows to identify and prevent security threats. The system integrates with GitLab/GitHub webhooks, uses machine learning for anomaly detection, and provides a dashboard for security teams to monitor pipeline integrity.

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**: Machine learning models analyze commit patterns and pipeline activities
- **Real-time Webhook Monitoring**: Integrates with GitLab/GitHub for instant threat detection
- **Risk Scoring Engine**: Dynamic scoring based on multiple security indicators
- **Alert Management**: Configurable alerts via Slack and email
- **Interactive Dashboard**: React-based UI for monitoring and analysis
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable backend with Python ML service and API layer

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Backend (Python)**: Core API, ML engine, and database services
- **Frontend (React)**: Dashboard for visualization and monitoring
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers and Kubernetes manifests
- **ML Models**: Pre-trained anomaly detection models
